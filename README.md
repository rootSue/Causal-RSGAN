## For users
The code for this project is based on the Pytorch implementation of StyleGAN2+ADA. Thanks a lot for their work. Please first read the instructions provided for StyleGAN2+ADA. We mainly modify training/loss.py and training/networks.py. The instructions are the same as [StyleGAN2-ada-pytorch](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch).
